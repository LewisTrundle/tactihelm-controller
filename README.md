# Tactihelm Controller

Welcome to the repo for the TactiHelm Controller: a mobile application developed for use with the [TactiHelm Project](https://github.com/LewisTrundle/tactihelm-l5project).

This app connects to a [Garmin Varia RTL515](https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/p/698001) bike radar using Bluetooth Low Energy and sends the distance and speed of approaching vehicles to a connected Arduino Uno using Bluetooth Classic. The app allows all manual control over the parameters of delivered vibrotactile stimuli, such as its intensity and location.

To use the controller app, please download and install the provided Android apk on an Android device.

Developed for my Level 5 Computing Science MSci Project at the University of Glasgow.
